        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Johan Philip and I am a second year Computer Science student at TMU.</p>
        <p>
          My university journey began as a Bachelor of Health Sciences student at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa with
          the hopes of becoming a doctor or a physical therapist. However during my winter semester of 1st
          year Biology, we did a lab in which bioinformatics was the topic of discussion. Upon researching and learning
          more about the field, I discovered how interconnected Computer Science and healthcare was and how Computer
          Scientists could do far more than being Software Developers or Cybersecurity Analysts.</p>
        <p>So I made the decision to transfer and begin doing Computer Science at TMU. While doing my first year
          courses,
          I began to find Software Development and Object-Oriented Programming very fascinating and began teaching
          myself
          Web Development and building projects. My decision to take CPS530 stemmed from a desire to ensure that the
          knowledge I have is correct and to fill in gaps in my knowledge.</p>
        <p>When speaking more about my personal life, I was born in India. I lived in Kuwait till I was 7 when my family
          and I moved to Canada. For the past 14 years, I have called the great town of Ajax my home.</p>

        <h2>Coding & I</h2>
        <p>Having taken a programming class in grade 10 that taught me Turing, I found programming to be extremely
          boring and tedious and not at all something I wanted to do for a career. Being an active person who enjoyed
          working with my hands and being on the move, as well as someone who loved Biology and Science, I wanted to be
          become a doctor or a physiotherapist.</p>
        <p>However, as fate would have it, I ended up finding my way back to programming as I mentioned in the previous
          section. As such, my late start to programming has meant that I have felt like I am quite behind in my
          knowledge,
          abilities and career preparedness (projects, etc) in comparison to my colleagues.</p>
        <p>However, my new found passion for Software Development has spurred me to begin building an Inventory
          Management
          system for my current part-time workplace, a walk-in clinic.
        </p>
        <p>The Inventory System will help ease the burden on my manager and provide a better alternative to the current
          inventory practice, which is just writting things
          down on paper. As this is my first major project, I have ran in several bugs and issues that have taught me
          much
          more about software and web development.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of that project and ensuring that it works as intended, I hope to create an appointment
          scheduling system that will help move the clinic away from using pen and paper for appointment registration
          and truly digitize our patient intake process. I am hoping that through this process I will learn further
          skills about software developemnt whilst also creating technology that solves a real world problem. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <details>
          <summary class="hobbies-title">Soccer</summary>
          <p>Growing up, I fell in love with the sport of soccer due to my dad. My first memory of watching a game was
            the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Since then, I grown up watching and playing soccer. I have played soccer
            throughout
            my elementary, middle school and high school career. I have also played on other teams.</p>

        <details>
          <summary class="hobbies-title">Photography</summary>
          <p>Photography allows me to capture moments that cannot be described using words. I believe that a good
            image
            can convey a message that words cannot.</p>
          <p>I use a Sony A6400 and primarily shoot portraits for my church, my friends and for smaller events like
            baby
            showers, baptisms, and engagements.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary class="hobbies-title">Drumming</summary>
          <p>I began drumming in 2018 and have been drumming ever since. I began drumming so that I could partake in
            my
            church band and assist them as a drummer. In the past 6 years I have been able to join my church band as a
            bi-weekly drummer and pick up extra gigs during my spare time.</p>
